# staplr

This package provides functions to manipulate PDF files:

   - fill out PDF forms: get_fields() and set_fields() 
   - merge multiple PDF files into one: staple_pdf() 
   - remove selected pages from a file: remove_pages()
   - rename multiple files in a directory: rename_files()
   - rotate entire pdf document: rotate_pdf() 
   - rotate selected pages of a pdf file: rotate_pages()
   - Select pages from a file: select_pages()
   - splits single input PDF document into individual pages: split_pdf()
   - splits single input PDF document into parts from given points: split_from()

This package is still under development and this repository contains a development version of the R package *staplr*.


## Installation

staplr requires a Java installation on your system. You can get the latest version
of java from [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/). [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/) also works.

You can install the stable version from CRAN.

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('staplr', dependencies = TRUE)
```


You can install staplr from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pridiltal/staplr")
```


## Example
```{r dataset, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(staplr)
# Merge multiple PDF files into one
staple_pdf()

# This command prompts the user to select the file interactively. 
# Remove page 2 and 3 from the selected file.
remove_pages(rmpages = c(2,3))

# This function selects pages from a file;
select_pages(selpages = c(1,3))

# This function splits a single input PDF document into individual pages
split_pdf()

# This function writes renamed files back to directory
#if the directory contains 3 PDF files
rename_files(new_names = paste("file",1:3))

# These functions are to fill out pdf forms
get_fields() 
set_fields()
# This includes 2 external functions `get_fields` and `set_fields` 
# and files to use as examples.
# This is what the example file looks like
```

```{r echo=TRUE,, eval=FALSE}
# If you get path to this file by
pdfFile = system.file('testForm.pdf',package = 'staplr')

# And do
fields = get_fields(pdfFile)
# You'll get a list of fields that the pdf contains 
# along with some additional information about the fields.

# You make modifications in any of the fields by
fields$TextField1$value = 'this is text'
set_fields(pdfFile, 'newFile.pdf', fields)

# This will create a filled pdf file
```

## Troubleshooting

- While default java options should be enough for most use cases, if you need to,
you can change java options that is used to run pdftk by doing

```r
options('staplr_java_options' = '-Xmx512m') 
```

This option is not affected by `rJava` settings.

- This package uses [pdtk-java](https://gitlab.com/pdftk-java/pdftk) which requires
a working Java and rJava installation. If any problems arise it'll likely be because 
rJava cannot locate your `JAVA_HOME`. Make sure your `JAVA_HOME` is configured correctly. You may have to do `sudo R CMD javareconf` on
linux machines.

- If for any reason you'd prefer to run a local installation of pdftk rather than using the version
that is shipped with the package, do

```r
# set staplr_custom_pdftk to the path to local installation
# just setting to pdftk will do if it's already in your path
 options('staplr_custom_pdftk' = 'pdftk') 

```
If you want to do this, you can get the original version of pdftk from [here](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/). Note that MacOS users
with a version higher than "High Sierra" should use [this](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/pdftk_server-2.02-mac_osx-10.11-setup.pkg) version instead.


Make sure to set the option back to `NULL` if you want to use the built in pdftk later.
