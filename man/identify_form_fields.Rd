\usage{
identify_form_fields(
  input_filepath = NULL,
  output_filepath = NULL,
  overwrite = TRUE,
  convert_field_names = FALSE,
  encoding_warning = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_filepath}{the path of the input PDF file. The default is set to
NULL. IF NULL, it  prompt the user to select the folder interactively.}

\item{output_filepath}{the path of the output PDF file. The default is set to
NULL. IF NULL, it  prompt the user to select the folder interactively.}

\item{overwrite}{If a file exists in \code{output_filepath}, should it be overwritten.}

\item{convert_field_names}{By default \code{pdftk} will encode certain characters
of the field names in plain text UTF-8 so if using a non-latin alphabet, your
field names might be illegible. Setting this to TRUE will turn the UFT-8 code into
characters. However this process it not guaranteed to be perfect as pdftk does
not differentiate between encoded text and regular text using escape characters.
If you have field names that intentionally include components that look like encoded characters
this will attempt to fix them. Use this option only when necessary. If TRUE,
remember to set it to TRUE when using \code{\link{set_fields}} as well.}

\item{encoding_warning}{If field names include strings that look like plain text UTF-8
codes, the function will return a warning by default, suggesting setting \code{convert_field_names} to code{TRUE}.
If \code{encoding_warning} is \code{FALSE}, these warnings will be silenced.}
